- 👋 Hi, I’m @sman664
- 👀 I’m interested in game hacking, game development, cloud services and a bit of UI/UX development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of cloud and all its services from the biggest cloud service providers (AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are related to the cloud and involve backend Python with frontend Javascript. I enjoy doing C/C++ and Java for my hobby projects though!
